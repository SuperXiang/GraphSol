# GraphSol
A Protein Solubility Predictor developed by Graph Convolutional Network and Predicted Contact Map  

Please use [SPOT-Contact](https://sparks-lab.org/downloads/) to generate all the features. (This step will take most of the time.)
1D-features: BLOSUM, PSSM, HMM, SPIDER3
2D-features: SPOTCON

These six files could be generate two matrices files by using get1D_features.py and get2D_features.py, which will be use as the train.py

We will complete all the details later.

(Under developed...)
